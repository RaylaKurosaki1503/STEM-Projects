<!-- Exploring the Chaotic Behavior of the Double Pendulum System -->
#### _Chaotic Behavior of Double Pendulum Systems_

The double pendulum is a classic example of a chaotic system that exhibits complex and unpredictable behavior. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the double pendulum and analyze its chaotic characteristics. We begin by formulating the equations of motion using Lagrangian mechanics, considering the gravitational forces and constraints on the system. Through numerical simulations and computational techniques, we explore the evolution of the double pendulum system under various initial conditions. Our analysis reveals that the double pendulum demonstrates sensitive dependence on initial conditions, commonly referred to as the "butterfly effect." Small variations in the initial conditions lead to significant deviations in the system's subsequent motion, making long-term predictions challenging.

<!-- Red Blood Cell Production -->
#### _Red Blood Cell Production_

Red Blood Cells are present in the human body and their purpose is to deliver oxygen to the human body while giving carbon dioxide for humans to exhale. The purpose of this paper is to show that Red Blood Cells can maintain an equilibrium state if a certain condition is met. Multiple models have been tested to show that this condition is consistent given the proper assumptions. The first model being analyzed is a system of linear difference equations. The second model being analyzed is a system of linear differential equations. The third model being analyzed is a system of nonlinear difference equations. This condition is where $\gamma = 1$.
